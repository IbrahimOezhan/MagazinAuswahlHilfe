# MagazinAuswahlHilfe
A program that I made during an Internship in a couple weeks to determine the magazine type to be used in a toroidal winding machine based on inputs and a table with pre-set magazines and their data. The original program that they had made 20 somethingish years ago wasn't able to print the results using the company printer since the IP of the printer was hard coded and no one had access to the source code anymore so this program was made completely from scratch without any knowlege of how the old one worked. This was the first program that I made using WPF.
